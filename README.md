## Developers

### Modifying the progress bar

A filter can be used to modify the progress bar and percentage text before it is displayed on the screen.

The name of the filter hook is ```year_remaining_filter_progress_bar```.

Example code:

```
add_filter('year_remaining_filter_progress_bar', 'modify_progress_bar', 10);

function modify_progress_bar($bar) {
    $bar = str_replace("‚ñë","üôÅ", $bar);
    $bar = str_replace("‚ñì","üòÉ", $bar);

    return $bar;
}
```
